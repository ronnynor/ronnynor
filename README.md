Hello, world!🤙. I am a semi-senior programmer with four years of experience🤓. I have studied programming for six years then I have managed to learn to develop some technologies such as Android, both in Kotlin and Java; Frontent web development with React and Backend with PHP; database management with MySQL; among others💻.

My dream is in the direction of development teams then I founded QNecesitas, my own company, in October 2021🏢. There, working as CEO, I have participated in more than 15 projects helping me achieve essential skills for team management and modern programming👨‍💼.

About languages, my native language is Spanish but I am fluent in advanced English🌎.
